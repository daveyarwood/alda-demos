Hi everyone!

Since 2012, I've been working on Alda, a markup-like programming language for
music composition. Think "text in, music out":

```
piano: c8 d e f g a b > c
```

I designed the language to be easy to learn, especially for people with little
to no programming experience. At the same time, I've made the language runtime
flexible enough to be driven from the outside; this makes it possible for
programmers to do some really fun and interesting things in the realm of
algorithmic composition. I've written a lot of generative music by writing
Clojure programs that drive Alda.

Live A/V setup is hard, so I've taken the easy way out by sharing with you a
5-minute excerpt of a longer talk that I gave at Strange Loop last year. The
excerpt starts at 5:30 (this link should take you directly there) and ends
around 10:20 when I start talking about architecture.

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!
